# Data Analysis with R: Red Wine Quality
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project

## Introduction
This report describes how the quality of red wine is affected by the chemical properties and contents of the wine. The data set used for this analysis was the "wineQualityRed" csv file, obtained from the Udacity website. The dataset contains information on 11 features of 1599 different red wines, and the quality was graded from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent), by three wine experts. Nine of the features provided for each wine were related to chemical composition (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free and total sulfur dioxides, sulphates, alcohol) and two were related to the chemcial and physical properties of the wine (pH and density, respectively). Exploratory data analysis was carried out on this data set in order to gain insight into which of these features has the biggest impact on the quality of the red wines described here.

## Methods
The effect of the chemical features of the wine, on the quality rating, was investigated by:
1) Data visualisation: Univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots
2) Descriptive statistics
3) Linear regression modelling
